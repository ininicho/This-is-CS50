                                I will be 18 this year. I'm from Indonesia, a big nation right in the equator. I live in
                                Jakarta, the crowdest city in Indonesia. I just graduated high school
                                from Canisius Senior High School which is located right in the heart of Jakarta.
                                This year, I will be studying in the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p class="blog-post-meta para">I have a big passion in Mathematics and Computers.
                                Mathematics is one of my strong points in school. My leadership experience made me a great
                                problem solver. Furthermore, I have developed passion in Computers in these past years.
                                Algorithms and data structures are very fascinating for me. CS50 introduced most of these
                                concepts to me. However, I would love to study them deeper. Therefore, I am taking Honours Mathematics
                                in Waterloo to deepen my understanding of the world of Mathematics and Computers.</p>

                                <p class="blog-post-meta para">My hobbies include volleyball and mountain hiking.
                                I am part of my school's volleyball team. I play in the back as a libero. It is the most
                                underated position in volleyball. We do most of the work but people do not really recognize us.
                                Aside from playing volleyball, I love mountain hiking. Indonesia is an archipelago of volcanoes.
                                Hence, there are plenty of mountains to hike. Mountain hiking might be tiring at first. But once we
                                reach the top, all our hardwork pays off. It's pretty much similar in life. Hardwork always pays off.</p>
